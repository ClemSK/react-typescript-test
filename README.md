# react-typescript-test

learning react + typescript

I have previously followed the [Net Ninja Typescript tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZmKW9-I_k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI) which is in Vanilla TypeScript and a useful starting point before moving to React with TS.

I followed elements in the [React TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/) and the [7 part intro to React + TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL1NUl7fQ2I&list=PLG-Mk4wQm9_LyKE5EwoZz2_GGXR-zJ5Ml&index=1) by Techbase.

The code is not very clean but shows my workings.
